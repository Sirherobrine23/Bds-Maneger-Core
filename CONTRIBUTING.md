# Contributing to the core

We hope to have multiple platforms supported by the project, as I want to bring together multiple servers to be managed in one place.

Any new platform will have to fork the repository or open an issue to request the new platform.

1. not all servers can be added because of project licensing but we can talk to the maintainers if needed.
2. This project is designed to run on various operating systems such as Android, Linux, Windows and MacOS (other systems can be added to be supported).
